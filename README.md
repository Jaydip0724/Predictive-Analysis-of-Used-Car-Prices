# Predictive-Analysis-of-Used-Car-Prices
This project aims to predict used car prices using machine learning by analyzing features such as brand, year, mileage, and location. It involves data cleaning, EDA, feature selection, and regression modeling to deliver accurate price predictions.

The project demonstrates the complete data science workflow — from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to feature selection, model building, and performance evaluation.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict the selling price of used cars using regression models.
- Analyze the impact of different factors (year, mileage, location, etc.) on car prices.
- Implement feature selection techniques to improve model accuracy.
- Compare multiple machine learning algorithms for best performance.

---

## 🧩 Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing for missing/inconsistent values.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
- Feature selection using **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** and **Random Forest Feature Importance**.
- Multiple regression models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- Model evaluation using R² score and RMSE.
- Insight: Cars from high-humidity or coastal regions tend to have lower resale values due to corrosion.
